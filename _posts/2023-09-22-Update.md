My program is now complete, and it can search for YouTube videos and store the search results and video IDs in a CSV file. Additionally,
the program can scrape a user-specified number of comments and save them in another CSV file. I have created a graphical user interface 
for the program with the help of ChatGPT, as I had not done that before. In the next few days, I will upload a video in which I explain 
the functions and the code in more detail, using the example of "Modern Witches on Social Media." I will also develop a research question 
and demonstrate how this data can be used for religious studies purposes.
