In this project, I wanted to develop a scraper tailored to my specific needs. The goal was not just to create a scraper for YouTube but also for TikTok, X (Twitter), and Instagram.
Unfortunately, there are no accessible APIs for X, TikTok, and Instagram that can access their data. Therefore, it was not possible to develop a scraper for them within the given time frame.
There is an option to identify and save the data, but it hasn't been working properly yet. I decided to focus on YouTube first because there is an accessible API for it. However, I will continue
working on scrapers for the other platforms at irregular intervals, as it's important to include other social media platforms due to their distinct communities.

Twitter, for instance, is known for its aggressive and toxic community, and comparing these different communities can shed light on how they differ from each other. TikTok is especially intriguing to examine because it's the newest platform with the most users and views. I came across the #Witchtok hashtag on TikTok, which I'd like to investigate further. This hashtag generates approximately 80 million views per month and consistently ranks among the top hashtags. I aim to delve into why this hashtag is so popular and whether it's related to the popularity of esoteric practices. The hashtag is also associated with feminism, new spirituality, and religiosity. I'm interested in understanding why #Witchtok and modern witchcraft are gaining popularity and how society influences this trend. It's worth noting that there are esoteric and witchcraft movements with far-right and antisemitic backgrounds, which could pose a potential danger. Additionally, there is an opportunity to profit from rituals and esoteric tools, as evidenced by the #witchtok hashtag where many witches offer their services for a fee. An example of this is Shisha Rainbow, a self-proclaimed witch who runs an online witchcraft school and has published a book, gaining significant media attention.

Since I'm unable to investigate the hashtag on TikTok, where it's most prevalent, I've developed a scraper specifically for YouTube. This scraper can be used for various topics and generate a wide range of data. This is just the foundation for future investigations using the collected data. With this project, I want to demonstrate how such data can be gathered and made usable for further research, providing insight into the possibilities these datasets offer.

Originally, the program was intended to be a single application where users could select the desired function. However, issues kept arising, and I couldn't pinpoint the exact problem. Therefore, I've decided to release two separate programs initially and then combine them later. One of these programs is the YouTube search program, which allows users to initiate a YouTube video search. A valid Google API key must be entered for this function. Users can also input a search term for YouTube video search, and in the third field, they can specify the number of videos to retrieve. Without a valid API key, access to YouTube's data is not possible. With this key, users can search for videos on YouTube. In addition to the basic search, this program offers more functionality. Users can specify the number of search results they want to display and enter the search term. Once the search is initiated, the results are displayed in the lower window, showing the video's name, description, views, likes, publication date, and video ID. These pieces of information can be saved in a .csv file, providing a tabular overview of the data for further use. The video ID is essential for the comment scraper, which can also collect YouTube comments and save them in a .csv file. Users can enter the YouTube video ID in the scraper and specify the number of comments to scrape. If this field is left empty, all comments associated with the video are collected. The data is then saved directly in a .csv file, creating a dataset that can be easily searched and analyzed. In my bachelor's thesis, I also analyzed YouTube videos and comments, but it was done without the assistance of a scraper, which was a time-consuming process to collect and organize the data. Additionally, due to the significant time investment, I was limited to a small dataset. A scraper would have saved me a lot of time and provided me with more data to work with, highlighting the advantages of such a tool. While this scraper is currently tailored to my needs, it can be customized to meet individual requirements with Python programming skills. ChatGPT can also assist if users encounter any difficulties. The graphical user interface (GUI) was initially created with ChatGPT and can later be adapted to meet specific needs. In the future, there might be a version of the scraper that allows users to specify exactly which data to collect, eliminating the need for programming skills. This project will involve generating data related to #witchtok and offer insights into how this data can be used. I will focus on the self-proclaimed witch Shisha Rainbow, as she has had a significant online presence. First, I will introduce Shisha Rainbow and her online presence. Then, I will search for videos using the scraper that mention her name and collect the comments under those videos. Subsequently, we can analyze the video formats in which she appeared and the audience's reactions in the comments.

This project demonstrates the significance of Digital Humanities in the field of religious studies and how they open up entirely new research areas and approaches, such as video games or social media, which play a substantial role in our digital society. This is evident in the growing importance and advancement of AI. In the future, Google might provide a direct AI interface that can access YouTube data, potentially eliminating the need for a scraper or other tools. In the coming days, I will release the data and provide an outlook on its potential uses. I will also create a brief overview video of the program code and a tutorial on how the programs function.
