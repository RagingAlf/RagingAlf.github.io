#  Scraping
I tried to find out how I can scrape data from the YouTube or TikTok. It is possible to do this with a Python code and your Google API ID.
This is the code that I used:

from googleapiclient.discovery import build

# API-KEY
API_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY'

# YouTube Data API initialising
youtube = build('youtube', 'v3', developerKey=API_KEY)

# Video search example
def search_videos(query):
    response = youtube.search().list(
        q=query,
        part='id,snippet',
        type='video',
        maxResults=10
    ).execute()

    for item in response['items']:
        video_id = item['id']['videoId']
        title = item['snippet']['title']
        print(f"Video ID: {video_id}, Title: {title}")

# example
search_videos('Python tutorial')

And there is a second method with a plugin for chrome. This is the much easier way, but it is not free of charge and in the free version of this plugin you can only scrape 20 entries, so I think it is better to write your own code, and it is possible to add more function like save the data in a .csv file. It is also possible to Scrape the commentaries.
